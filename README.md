# Issues 
This is a public issue-tracking repository for bugs and confirmed features related to the Habbo Secret Service's online services, which is maintained by the Online Services Administration.

**If you find a potential exploit or vulnerability, please exercise reasonable disclosure:**
- Privately contact an OSA Developer 
- Do not publicly disclose the issue immediately (give our team adequate time to respond to and address your inquiry before you disclose the vulnerability publicly).

# Submitting 
Issues can be [submitted](https://github.com/osateam/ssonline/issues/new) at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/osateam/ssonline/issues).

# Guidlines 
- Follow the formatting guide to the best of your ability, although optional.
- Search the issue tracker to ensure that your issue is not a duplicate
- Verify the validity and/or plausibility of your issue
- Be clear and concise in your description
- Do not bump issues to receive a response (all issues are acknowledged)
- Do not argue unproductively in an issue's comments
- Do not re-create an issue you feel unjustly closed

# Formatting 
It is recommended that issues are formatted using the following template for maximum clarity and readability, so the issue can be fixed sooner than later.

Try to separate your description into three different sections, if possible:

1. **The issue**: This section should provide a detailed explanation of the issue.
2. **Steps to reproduce**: If applicable, provide a detailed list of steps needed to reproduce the issue.
3. **Miscellaneous information**: Information that doesn't necessarily fit into any other sections. Common examples are attachments, images, or disclaimers.
